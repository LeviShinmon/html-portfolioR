<h1>Adni's review on the John Wick Franchise</h1>

<h2>My Opinion on each movie. </h2>
<hr />

<h3>John Wick 1</h3>
<p>Action Packed. Gives us a worthy introduction to the character and his motivations. He isn't a good guy(technically), but he's someone you can root for because of the circumstances, and that's what makes the story compelling. Vigo, the main villain, also has his reasons for doing what he does. Protecting family is a noble goal, even when that family is idiotic. All in all, great reasons for both men to do what they did. To be honest, while I was more on John's side, I still had sympathy for the difficult choices Vigo had to make.</p>

<h3>John Wick 2</h3>
<p>Mr Wick's re-entry into the world of assassins has unintended consequences. An old "friend" comes back asking John to do a job, and John cannot refuse because he is legally bound to said person by a marker(a blood oath in the John Wick mythos). Job goes well/wrong depending on your perspective, but a bounty is placed on his head making him a wanted man. Taking the franchise to newer heights by exploring the world of John Wick and once again, giving us a hard choice in terms of who to root for, John Wick 2 was exceptional from the start to the end.</p>

<h3>John Wick 3</h3>
<p>As a result of his actions in the previous movie, Mr Wick is excommunicated and hunted even more fiercely. Seeking redemption, John runs for his life while searching for a way to return to the good graces of the high table. Once again, we get former friends pitted against each other, and difficult choices have to be made. A story of friendship, grudges, betrayal, and hatred. Pure hatred. John Wich 3 ends with the promise of carnage in the next installment.</p>

<h4>John Wick 4</h4>
<p>By far the worst movie of the 4. I actually detest this movie. From it's usurping of the plot of the previous movie, to the needless deaths of certain characters just introduced, this was a shitshow. Go see for yourselves.</p>
